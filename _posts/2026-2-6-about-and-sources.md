# Some Notes About How the Project Is Going

This project actually started a long time ago before writing this post. However, I paused it for a while due to several reasons and challenges.

Some of these struggles were related to the project itself, while others were personal. In this post, I want to focus on the project-related challenges and clarify a few things about the journey so far.

## Motivation

I created this blog to document my journey in building this operating system from scratch.

The main goal is to keep track of every step I take — from early experiments and learning phases to major updates and design changes. Whenever I modify something, improve a component, or face a challenge, I try to write about it here.

This blog is not only a personal log but also a way to share knowledge with anyone who is interested in operating systems development and low-level programming.

## References

This journey began with a strong passion to learn about operating systems and eventually build one for myself.

I started searching for the required knowledge and found many useful resources. Based on several Reddit posts and technical blogs, I decided to begin with the **x86 architecture** and follow a structured learning path by
watching this YouTube playlist to better understand **x86 architecture**:
[8086 - Bharat Acharya](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfzBO7vcQZ1Kyq7RNPJM5NUP-PWwRVZOX&si=6pvl1IRRNkLQYKDx)

In addition, I followed the main reference for operating system development:
[osdev.org](https://osdev.org/)

And i also was reading these books :

- [Operating Systems: From 0 to 1](https://github.com/saeeedhany/references/blob/main/OS/Operating%20Systems%20-%20Three%20Easy%20Pieces.pdf)
- [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://github.com/saeeedhany/references/blob/main/OS/Operating_Systems_From_0_to_1.pdf)
- [The Little Book About OS Development](https://github.com/saeeedhany/references/blob/main/OS/book.pdf)

And lately I've known another good book from It's author named [Mohammed Q. Hussain](https://github.com/MaaSTaaR) With it's book :

- [A Journey in Creating an Operating System Kernel](https://github.com/saeeedhany/references/blob/main/OS/A_Journey_in_Creating_an_Operating_System_Kernel_The_539kernel_Book.pdf)

> I am actually reading it because it's funny and i really loved his writting way, It's so smooth and direct.

## Some Thoughts

This project represents my true passion and the field I want to pursue as a career.

Even though the learning process includes many frustrating moments, I genuinely enjoy every step of it. One thing I would really love is to have people who share the same passion — whether by adopting the idea, giving feedback, or contributing in any possible way.

So if you're reading this right now and feel that you can offer something, I would truly appreciate it.
